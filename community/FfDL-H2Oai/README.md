# Perform Automated Machine Learning With H2O on FfDL

[H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai) provides an open source platform for automated machine learning: [H2O-3](https://www.h2o.ai/h2o/)

H2O is an open source, in-memory, distributed, fast, and scalable machine learning and predictive analytics platform that allows you to build machine learning models on big data and provides easy productionalization of those models in an enterprise environment.

# Deployment Steps

1. Follow steps to deploy FfDL from the [user guide](https://github.com/IBM/FfDL/blob/master/docs/user-guide.md)
2. Add some data, either follow the user guide to store the data locally or host the data in a cloud storage bucket and pull it at runtime.
3. Change the manifest.yaml to the settings that you want
  * NOTE: It is recommended that you allocate at least 4x the amount of memory as the size of the dataset you are trying to run H2O with.
  * EXAMPLE: 1.5GB Dataset --> 6.0 GB Memory allocated
4. Once FfDL is deployed in your Kubernetes cluster, use the CLI or GUI to deploy H2O

# Examples
sample deployment scripts are hosted under: FfDL/community/FfDL-H2Oai

If you need a sample dataset, you can pull this toy dataset:
