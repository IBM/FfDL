# FfDL-Dashboard
Provide a easy-to-use FfDL UI that enables visualization of training progress.

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have the FfDL stack running, and that you know the Rest API port.

## Installation
TODO: Explain how to install the dashboard into the minikube cluster
using a makefile or other sane process.

## Developer Notes
This project was seeded with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.2.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

#### Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
