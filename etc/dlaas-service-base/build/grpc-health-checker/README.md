# Health Checker for gRPC

This is a simple CLI utility for checking if a gRPC service is healthy. It assumes
that the gRPC service provides the [Health Checking Service](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md).

This utility will connect to the above service and the following error codes:
* exit code 0: `status == HealthCheckResponse_SERVING`
* exit code 1: an error occurred connecting to the service or retrieving a health check response
* exit code 2: `status == HealthCheckResponse_UNKNOWN`
* exit code 3: `status == HealthCheckResponse_NOT_SERVING`

Generally speaking, any error code != 0 means the service is not healthy. The error code mapping
just helps to classify it a bit further, if needed.
